# Advanced Topics in NLP Final Project

## üìù Description
This is my final project for the UCPH course [Advanced Topics in Natural Language Processing](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/NDAK19001U/2022-2023) (ATNLP). The project goal was two fold. The first part was a reproduction study of the paper *Generalization without Systematicity* by Lake and Baroni. The second part was free-form, where i chose to investigate in-context learning for experiment 3. My report can be found [here](https://github.com/hojmax/ATNLP/blob/main/Paper.pdf).

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

You will need a [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) account to log the experiments. You will be prompted to enter your API key when running the notebook. You should the `wandb_project`and `wandb_entity` variables at the top of the notebook to match your account.

### Local

For local use, simply run the `main.ipynb` notebook.

### Colab

When using colab, upload the `main.ipynb` notebook. Afterwards, add a cell to the top of the notebook with the following content:

```python
!git clone https://github.com/hojmax/ATNLP.git
%cd /content/ATNLP
```

You can then run the notebook as usual.
