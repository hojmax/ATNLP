# ATNLP: Paper Implementation

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

### Local

For local use, simply run the `main.ipynb` notebook.

### Colab

When using colab, upload the `main.ipynb` notebook. Afterwards, add a cell to the top of the notebook with the following content:

```python
!git clone https://git_token@github.com/hojmax/Individual-ATNLP.git
%cd /content/Individual-ATNLP
```

The `git_token` should be replaced by your personal access token, and is required since the repo is private. You can generate a token by going to:

Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens -> Tokens (classic)

When you push to the repository, you need to run `!git pull` and restart the runtime for the changes to take effect.
